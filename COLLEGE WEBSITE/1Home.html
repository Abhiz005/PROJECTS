<div class="para">AGILE, AlERT, AWAKE !

Very pleased to connect again with you all as new academic year has begun after two years of Pandemic. As it is said storm makes us stronger and never lasts for ever. We have observed that difficulties strengthen the mind just as labour does to body. Appreciate the resilience in each one of you to get back to academics and engaging in your pursuits with the help of enthusiastic teaching staff . Though the challenges are many we have to move on, excel, and create new bench marks.

It is time to redefine quotients that we are familiar with like intelligent &Emotional quotient and work on other quotients like social, political, moral, existential, digital and spiritual. We wish to create corporate citizens & compassionate people and not just graduates when you leave the portals of this institute

After three years of Autonomous status we have revised respective curriculum across all courses making it more relevant to students. We envisage many learning outcomes to be attained like conceptual clarity, critical thinking, emotional maturity, team spirit, scientific temper, discipline, and above all human excellence. We are digital immigrants and I am sure our students as digital ambassadors shall take forward all the competency skills in their chosen endeavours.

With changing trends in education we have started B.Sc. in Data science and B.Sc. in Environmental science to prepare the students for better prospectus in research as well is in employment. Under RUSA grant am glad many of the students could enrol in many skill based courses. We could also utilize the fund fully for infrastructure, equipment and amenities. Every facility that we provide comes with a cost and maintaining them is your responsibility. My best wishes for an enriching and fruitful years at SIES and take this opportunity to discover your potentials. Be agile, alert awake !!!

Principal.
