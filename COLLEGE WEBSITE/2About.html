  Affiliated to the University of Mumbai, the college has an impressive strength of over 4,000 students drawn from all sections of this cosmopolitan city.

Excellent results at various University and Board examinations, and coveted awards and merit positons bagged by the students have placed the S.I.E.S. College 
among the most outstanding institutions in the city. The college has attained its position due to committment and dedication of Principals like Prof. A. B. Shah (1960-63),
